# NoCanHardware

Hardware projects for NoCan based projects



Based on the open source projects at omzlo.com, these projects add support for a castellated network module that can be reused across other input and output nodes.

Typical projects include a 4 channel dimmer output node, 3 channel relay output node, and input nodes for a 6 switch/temp sensor/occupancy/security PIR.

Also an interface to weigand keypads
