Can Bus Messages



Header contains an identifier ?11 bits), which determines the priority of the message.

Is this used as the id of the sending node, because ideally we'd want to use this as a high priority signal for say smoke /security alarms, then occupancy, then light switches, then feedback etc



Also ther are filters which I think are limited to 12 which are used to only pas through messages that match a given mask. Need to figure out how this works some more
